# Rule version v1.0.0

- name: "WMI Incoming Lateral Movement"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Identifies processes executed via Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) on a remote host. This could be indicative of
                adversary lateral movement, but could be noisy if administrators use WMI to remotely manage hosts."
  solution: "Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      If the triage identified malware, search the environment for additional compromised hosts.
      Implement temporary network rules, procedures, and segmentation to contain the malware.
      Stop suspicious processes. Immediately block the identified indicators of compromise (IoCs).
      Inspect the affected systems for additional malware backdoors like reverse shells, reverse proxies, or droppers that
      attackers could use to reinfect the system. Remove and block malicious artifacts identified during triage.
      Review the privileges needed to write to the network share and restrict write access as needed.
      Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector."
