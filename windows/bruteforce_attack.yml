# Rule version v1.0.3

- name: "Windows: Possible Brute Force Attack"
  severity: "High"
  description: "This rule is triggered when a pattern of repeated and rapid login attempts from the same IP address or source is detected. 
                These login attempts may target specific user accounts or services in an attempt to crack passwords through automated brute force. 
                The purpose of this rule is to identify possible malicious unauthorized access attempts and prevent a brute force attack against the system."
  solution: "It is recommended to block the suspicious IP address, implement temporary blocking policies for accounts with failed attempts, strengthen passwords, 
            maintain constant monitoring, and use perimeter security measures such as firewalls to mitigate the risks associated with brute force attempts. 
            Early detection and rapid response are key to protecting the system against potential malicious attacks."
