# Rule version v1.0.1

- name: "Adding Hidden File Attribute via Attrib"
  severity: "Low"
  description: "Adversaries can add the hidden attribute to files to hide them from the user in an attempt to evade detection."
  solution: "Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      If the triage identified malware, search the environment for additional compromised hosts.
      Implement temporary network rules, procedures, and segmentation to contain the malware. Stop suspicious processes.
      Immediately block the identified indicators of compromise (IoCs).
      Inspect the affected systems for additional malware backdoors like reverse shells, reverse proxies, or droppers that
      attackers could use to reinfect the system. Remove and block malicious artifacts identified during triage.
      Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and
      malware components. Delete or set the key to its default value.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector."
