# Rule version v1.0.0

- name: "Windows: Suspicious service was installed in the system"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Identifies the creation of a new Windows service with suspicious Service command values. Windows services typically run
                as SYSTEM and can be used for privilege escalation and persistence."
  solution: "Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are
      identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.
      Delete the service or restore it to the original configuration.
      Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector."
  category: "Persistence"
  tactic: "Create or Modify System Process"
